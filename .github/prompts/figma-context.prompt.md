Read the design context from the following pre-exported Figma MCP files:
- figma-context/home-hero.md
- figma-context/home-trending.md
- figma-context/home-colors.md
- figma-context/home-testimonial.md
- figma-context/home-service.md
- figma-context/home-blog.md

These files contain the real Figma MCP output: node structure, design specs, typography, colors, image asset paths, and generated code (React+Tailwind to be converted).

Image assets are already saved in public/images/.

Implement the home page in src/app/features/home/ using the existing design system components. Reference images as `images/filename.png`.
